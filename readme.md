## Introduction

Software Vulnerabilities (SVs) are security weaknesses and flaws
that are exploitable in cyber-attacks. Delay in the assessment of SVs
might cause serious consequences due to the unknown impacts of
the SVs on the attacked systems. The state-of-the-art approach has
been proposed to work directly on the committed code changes that
were deemed to have vulnerable code, and produces the assessment
grades for the vulnerability without waiting until the SV reports
are filed. However, the existing approach still has low accuracy
due to its limited code change representations and surrounding
contexts. In this work, we propose CAT, a Context-aware, Graphbased,
Commit-level Vulnerability Assessment Model that evaluates
a vulnerability-introducing code and provides the CVSS assessment
grades for the vulnerability. One of the key solutions is a novel
context-aware, graph-based, representation learning (RL) model
to learn the contextualized embeddings for the code changes that
integrate program dependencies and the surrounding contexts of
code changes. We utilize the contextualized embeddings to learn to
provide the CVSS assessment grades for the vulnerability. During
the assessment of one aspect, we also consider the impacts of the
other aspects by leveraging a multi-task learning model (each task
learning to assess one aspect) to propagate the learning from one
task to another. Our empirical evaluation shows that on a large
dataset of vulnerabilities in C code, CAT achieves F-score of 25.5%
and MCC of 26.9% relatively higher than the state-of-the-art model
in vulnerability assessment. In the dataset of vulnerabilities in Java
code, CAT achieves F-score of 14.3% and MCC of 8.0% relatively
higher than the state-of-the-art model in vulnerability assessment.

## Dataset

### Preprocessed Dataset

We published our processed C dataset at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kms3Xr5xkSA6gu9AErbFigsgaTgm25id/view?usp=sharing

Please create a folder named ```data``` under the root folder of CAT, download the dataset, unzip it and put all files in ```./data``` folder.

The Java dataset we used is from ```DeepCVA: Automated Commit-level Vulnerability Assessment with Deep Multi-task Learning``` research. Please reach this research for more information. 

### Use your own dataset

If you want to use your own dataset, please prepare the data as follow:

1. The data are stored in ```data_n.pt```

2. Each ```data_n.pt``` include a set of ```Data``` object from ```torch_geometric```. Each ```Data``` represent a method in a vulnerability introducing commit:
	
	1> ```Data.x = Node_feature_vector```
	
	2> ```Data.y = [label_1, ..., label_7]```
	
	3> ```Data.edge_index = edge_list```
	
Where ```Node_feature_vector``` is ```N*R``` sized torch tensors that represent the node features in the graph, ```N``` is the number of nodes on the graph and ```R``` is the representation vector length.

```edge_list``` is  the matrixs to represent the graph edges for each method. Please refer to ```torch_geometric``` package for more details.

```label_1, ... ,label_7``` are the true labels for seven different vulnerability assessment types.

## Requirement

Install ```Torch``` by following the Instruction from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally).

Install ```torch_sparse``` by following the Instruction from [pytorch_sparse](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_sparse).

Install ```torch_geometric``` by following the Instruction from [torch_geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).

See [requirement.txt](https://github.com/Vulnerability-Assessment/vulnerability-assessment/CAT/requirement.txt) for other required packages. 


## Instruction_to_Run_CAT

Download the CAT source code and run ```main.py``` to see the result for our experiment. 

## Demo

Because the dataset that used in our approaches contains big graphs which are huge and the model may take a long time to well trained and tested. To quickly try our model, please download our demo that contains just limited amount of data. 

Demo download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ruxgWuAT4DPcSyRue0beooXNi0Y82YAv/view?usp=sharing

Put ```model.pt``` and ```data``` in the root folder of CAT and then run ```run_demo.py``` to see the results.
